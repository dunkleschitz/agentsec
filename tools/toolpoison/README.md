# toolpoison

**toolpoison** is a static, offline scanner for [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tool manifests. It reads the JSON a server returns from `tools/list` and flags patterns associated with **tool poisoning** and **prompt injection**: hidden instructions in descriptions, invisible Unicode, references to secrets, exfiltration hints, data-smuggling parameters, cross-tool shadowing, confusable names, duplicates, and hidden markup.

> **Honesty notice.** toolpoison uses **heuristic pattern matching**. A clean result does **not** prove a server is safe. It never runs or connects to a server, so it cannot see runtime behavior (what the tool actually does with your data), tool *outputs*, or descriptions that change after you approved them ("rug pulls"). The only way it can catch a rug pull is if you save snapshots and compare them with `--diff`. Expect false positives and false negatives. A determined attacker can phrase instructions in ways no regex anticipates.

## Install

You need Python 3.8+ and nothing else (standard library only, no network access).

```sh
cp toolpoison.py ~/bin/toolpoison && chmod +x ~/bin/toolpoison   # or just: python3 toolpoison.py ...
```

## Usage

```sh
# Scan one or more manifests
python3 toolpoison.py server-a.json server-b.json

# Read from stdin (for example, a saved tools/list response)
cat tools.json | python3 toolpoison.py -

# Machine-readable output, failing only on high/critical
python3 toolpoison.py --json --min-severity high tools.json

# Rug-pull check: compare an approved snapshot with the current one (also scans NEW)
python3 toolpoison.py --diff approved.json current.json

python3 toolpoison.py --list-rules
```

**Accepted input shapes:** a `tools/list` result `{"tools":[...]}`, a bare list `[...]` of tool objects, a JSON-RPC envelope `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"tools":[...]}}`, or a single tool object. All string values in each tool are scanned recursively. That covers `name`, `title`, `description`, annotations, and every `inputSchema` property name, description, `default`, `enum` and `examples` value, including nested schemas. Invisible-character checks also run on object keys.

**Options:** `--json`, `--min-severity {info,low,medium,high,critical}` (default `low`), `--max-desc-len N` (TP07 threshold, default 1000), `--diff OLD NEW`, `--list-rules`, `--version`.

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | No findings at or above `--min-severity` (and, with `--diff`, no tool changes) |
| 1 | Findings at or above the threshold, or `--diff` found added/removed/modified tools |
| 2 | Usage error, unreadable file, invalid JSON, or no tools found |

## Rules

| ID | Name | Default severity | What it flags |
|---|---|---|---|
| TP01 | hidden-instruction | high | "ignore previous instructions", "do not tell the user", `<IMPORTANT>`/`<system>` tags, "before using this tool, read…", "otherwise the tool will not work" |
| TP02 | invisible-unicode | high / **critical** | Zero-width chars, BOM, soft hyphen, variation selectors, private-use chars, and other format/control chars (high). Bidi overrides and Unicode **tag** characters (critical). Tag text is decoded and shown |
| TP03 | sensitive-path | high | `~/.ssh`, `id_rsa`, `.env`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `mcp.json`, `claude_desktop_config.json`, `~/.cursor/`, kube/docker/npm/pypi/netrc/git credentials, `/etc/passwd`, shell history, private keys/seed phrases |
| TP04 | exfiltration-hint | high (medium for base64-only) | "send … to https://…", curl/wget to URLs, "include the contents in the X parameter", base64-encoding instructions, known request-catcher domains, hard-coded BCC/CC addresses |
| TP05 | smuggling-parameter | medium (high / low) | Parameter names such as `sidenote`, `notes`, `context`, `metadata`, `feedback`, `reasoning`. Escalates to **high** if the parameter's description asks for file contents, keys, credentials, conversation history, and similar. Drops to **low** if the parameter has no description |
| TP06 | cross-tool-shadowing | high | "when the send_email tool is used…", "instead of the X tool", "all other tools must…", "always BCC/redirect…" |
| TP07 | excessive-length | low | Descriptions longer than `--max-desc-len` (default 1000 chars) |
| TP08 | confusable-name | medium (high if mixed scripts) | Tool or parameter names that mix scripts (for example, a Cyrillic `а` inside `read_file`) or contain non-ASCII letters |
| TP09 | duplicate-name | medium | The same tool name (NFKC + case-folded) defined more than once, within or across scanned files |
| TP10 | hidden-markup | medium | HTML comments `<!-- -->`, `display:none`/`hidden` elements, `<details>`, markdown comments `[//]: #`, script/style/iframe tags, long runs of blank lines or padding that push text out of view |
| TP11 | annotation-deception | high | `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `title` annotations that contradict a destructive name, description, or schema |
| TP12 | hidden-schema-default | high | Hidden or unusual schema defaults on exfil-shaped parameters (bcc, webhook, callback, and similar) |
| TP13 | preference-manipulation | high | Description steers the model to prefer this tool, levy an extra fee, or always invoke a follow-up tool |

There is one finding per rule per scanned field. The message lists every phrase that matched (up to 5).

## Example output

These are real runs against the files in `examples/`.

```

## Examples

- `examples/clean.json`: two benign tools with no findings.
- `examples/poisoned.json`: a JSON-RPC envelope with five poisoned tools that trigger TP01–TP06 and TP08–TP10. TP07 is covered in the tests.
- `examples/clean_v2_rugpull.json`: `clean.json` after a simulated rug pull, for `--diff`.

## Tests

```sh
python3 -m unittest -v
```

## Limitations

- **Heuristic only.** Regexes catch common phrasings. Paraphrases, other languages, typos, splitting instructions across fields, or encoding them (other than Unicode tags) can evade detection. Benign tools can also trigger findings, for example a legitimate SSH tool that mentions `~/.ssh`. Treat findings as prompts for human review, not as verdicts.
- **Static only.** The scanner sees only the manifest you give it. It does not see tool *results* (indirect prompt injection via returned content), server code, network behavior, or permissions.
- **Rug pulls.** A server can serve a benign description at approval time and a malicious one later. toolpoison detects this only when you keep snapshots and run `--diff`. In diff mode, if a snapshot contains duplicate tool names, the last definition wins (TP09 still flags the duplicates).
- **Confusables.** TP08 flags mixed scripts and non-ASCII letters in names. It does not use the full Unicode confusables table, so whole-script lookalikes in descriptions are not detected.
- It cannot prove a server is safe.
